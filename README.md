# RunnerJumperGame
**Runner Game** is a simple 2D platformer made with Python and Pygame. Players control a character who jumps over obstacles (snails) using the spacebar or mouse. The goal is to achieve the highest score before colliding with an obstacle. With retro pixel art and a dynamic score system, it's easy to play and highly replayable.
